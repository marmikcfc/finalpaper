# Securing Clouds- The Quantum Way
Repository for my final class paper on Securing Clouds using Quantu Cryptography

## Abstract
CIA triad â€“ Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are basic goals of security architecture. To ensure CIA, many authentication scheme has been introduced in several years. Currently deployment of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a most significant solution. PKI involving exchange key using certificates via a public channel to a authenticate users in the cloud infrastructure. It is exposed to widespread security threats such as eavesdropping, man in the middle attack, masquerade et al. Quantum  cryptography  is  one  of  the  most  prominent  fields  in  modern  world  of  information security. Quantum cryptography is considered to be a future replica of classical cryptography along with a vital stance to break existing classical cryptography. This paper aims to look into basic security architecture in place currently and further it tries to introduce a new proposed security architecture for cloud computing environment, which makes use of the knowledge of Quantum Mechanics and current advances in research in Quantum Computing, to provide a more secure architecture.
